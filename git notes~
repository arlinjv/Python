merged scripts on Vaio and Asus
named repository Python which maybe was a mistake because folder is named scripts. It contains mostly python stuff but there is a lua folder, too.
How I got here:
- Vaio
	- git init
	- git add .
	- git commit -m 'initial repository added'
	- git remote add origin git@github.com:arlinjv/Python.git
	- git push -u origin master
	- git pull (to pick up changes made after adding Asus files)
- Asus
	- git init
	- git add
	- git pull https://github.com/arlinjv/Python
	- git commit -m "initial commit on Asus" (should maybe have done this before above)
	- git remote add origin https://github.com/arlinjv/Python.git
	- git push origin master
	- git status [showed deleted files not committed]
	- git rm -r .ipynb_checkpoints
	- git commit -m committing file deletions"
	- git push origin master
